# üå≥ *DeepTree* üå≥

Welcome to my GitHub *DeepTree* repository, where you‚Äôll find various Python packages & jupyter notebooks related to our latest project [publication](https://github.com/KristinaUlicna/CellComp "Team website") with the **CellX** team.


### PhD Project üë©‚Äçüî¨: Heterogeneity within Cell Populations üß¨

![Segmentation, Classification & Tracking Pipeline](track_pipeline.png)
Single Cell Proliferation and Colony Expansion Heterogeneity -> *Our custom-designed framework consists of deep learning-based cell annotation steps on pairs of transmission and fluorescence time-lapse microscopy images. Low-contrast fluorescence images represent an input to the cell segmentation network built using residual U-Net architecture, which separates individual cell nuclei (white) from background (black) by performing a pixel-wise cell vs. non-cell classification, yielding a binary segmentation masks. Localisation coordinates for each individual cell from the segmentation mask are used to crop an 80 x 80 pixel image glimpse centred around the cell nucleus from both transmission and fluorescence images, which serve as inputs to a convolutional neural network-based classifier to label instantaneous cell state based on cell morphology and nucleic acid condensation level. Labels indicate whether the cell is in interphase (grey), prophase (cyan), metaphase (magenta), anaphase (gold) or undergoes apoptosis (red). A full sequence of fully annotated fields of view capturing the duration of the time-lapse microscopy movies are supplied into the bTrack tracking algorithm, which reconstructs individual cell trajectories & stores the parent-children relationships to be extracted as 2D lineage tree visualisations.*

### Project Status:

WORK IN PROGRESS (Last update: 2020/07/30).
_Note: this is not the full repository (yet)_. I am currently restructuring my repo, so please bear with me while I do so. Once completed, you will find my code & supplementary [iPython](https://ipython.org/notebook.html "Jupyter Notebooks") notebooks divided into these sections:

- **single_cell_lineages:**
   + observe individual cell lineage tree representations from example time-lapse microscopy movie
   + map the intrinsic heterogeneity of the cell cycle durations & colony expansion capacity by individual clones
   + investigate the structure of stored cell segmentation, classification & tracking data by our `bTrack` pipeline

- **lineage_tree_analysis:**
   + visualise the heterogeneity of cell cycling times on large data scales
   + use our massive data repository to understand how cell cycling is descended across multiple downstream generations
   + exploit visibly heritable cycling patterns in extended cell families in automatically reconstructed, multi-generational, deep lineage trees in a **fully unsupervised** manner


### Prerequisites & Dependencies Installation

All code in the *CellComp* repository is written in Python and has been tested with Python 3.7+ on OS X. Most of the packages require the following additional packages, namely `numpy, scipy, h5py, matplotlib, tqdm`. For convenience, you can just run the following code to install all the dependencies:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Authors, Acknowledgments & Credits
