- **lineage_tree_analysis:**
   + visualise the heterogeneity of cell cycling times on large data scales
   + use our massive data repository to understand how cell cycling is descended across multiple downstream generations
   + exploit visibly heritable cycling patterns in extended cell families in automatically reconstructed, multi-generational, deep lineage trees in a **fully unsupervised** manner
