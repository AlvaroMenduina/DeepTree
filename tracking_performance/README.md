- **tracking_performance:**
   + learn how tracking results can be interpreted on image segmentation masks of low-contrast microscopy images
   + evaluate how well our `bTrack` tracking pipeline maintains the identities & trajectories of individual cells over long periods of time
   + visualise which cells can be tracked back to the very beginning of the movie (*survivor*; cyan), which cells migrated into the field of view (*incomer*; yellow), and where track breakage occurred (*mistrack*; red) to quickly identify & correct tracking errors

**Separation of Cells based on Their Tracking Status** -> _A colourised binary mask of a time-lapse microscopy field of view of medium confluency with individual cells highlighted as **survivors** if they can be tracked since the initial movie frame (cyan), **incomers** if they migrated into the field of view throughout the movie (yellow) or **mistracks** if an error occurred in the automated trajectory reconstruction (red)._
