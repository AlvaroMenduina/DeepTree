- **single_cell_lineages:**
   + observe individual cell lineage tree representations from example time-lapse microscopy movie
   + map the intrinsic heterogeneity of the cell cycle durations & colony expansion capacity by individual clones
   + investigate the structure of stored cell segmentation, classification & tracking data by our `bTrack` pipeline
